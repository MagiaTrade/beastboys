# Beastboys Library

Beastboys is a C++ library designed for handling network communication, including raw socket, WebSocket, and REST API connections. It provides a robust framework for building networked applications with support for both synchronous and asynchronous operations.

## Features

- **Raw Socket Connections**: Manage low-level socket connections with full control over data transmission.
- **WebSocket Connections**: Establish WebSocket connections for real-time communication with support for SSL.
- **REST API**: Interact with RESTful services using HTTP/HTTPS, supporting various HTTP methods and response handling.

### Required Packages

> **⚠️ Warning:** This project has only been tested on macOS.

To use `beastboys`, you need to install the following packages:

- [Boost (minimum version 1.83.0)](http://boost.org)
- [OpenSSL(version 1.1)](https://www.openssl.org)

Additionally, `beastboys` depends on the `mgutils` library as a submodule. The Boost library is also a dependency of `mgutils`.


#### macOS Installation

Install the required packages using Homebrew:

```sh
brew install boost@1.83.0
brew install openssl@1.1
```

#### Linux Installation

On Linux, you can install Boost and OpenSSL using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libboost1.83-dev libssl1.1-dev
```

If Boost 1.83.0 is not available in your distribution, you may need to download and build it manually from the [Boost website](https://www.boost.org/users/download/).

#### Windows Installation

On Windows, you can install Boost and OpenSSL using a package manager like vcpkg:

```sh
vcpkg install boost@1.83.0
vcpkg install openssl@1.1
```

Make sure to integrate vcpkg with your Visual Studio environment:

```sh
vcpkg integrate install
```
